# Longitudinal Study Data

## Purpose

This README documents studies that track participants over time with multiple data points. Special attention should be given to time-series structure and missing data handling.

## Sections to Include

### Study Design

- **Follow-up Duration:** Study length (e.g., 6 months, 2 years).
- **Assessment Intervals:** Frequency of data collection (e.g., weekly, monthly, annually).

### Data Collection Methods

- **Surveys:** Instruments used, frequency of administration.
- **Device Tracking:** Longitudinal wearable device data considerations.
- **Biological Sample Collection:** Timing and handling of repeated biological samples.

### Time-Series Considerations

- **Handling Missing Timepoints:** Strategies to address dropouts, intermittent missing data.
- **Participant Attrition:** Documenting reasons for loss to follow-up.

### Data Structure

- **Long vs. Wide Format:** Explanation of how repeated measures are structured.
- **Linking Repeated Measures:** Key identifiers for merging time-points.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- **Outlier Detection:** Techniques used to flag extreme values.
- **Trend Analysis:** How longitudinal patterns were analysed.
