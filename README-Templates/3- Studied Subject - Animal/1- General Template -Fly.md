## Dataset usage and access

### Licence
> For data that do not include code/ software, we recommend choosing one of the licenses below:

This dataset is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  
You are free to use, share, and adapt this dataset as long as you give appropriate credit.

>**or**

This dataset is released under the [CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). 
You are free to copy, modify, distribute, and use the data without restrictions.

> Generally, CC-BY 4.0 works well for scientific data as it states that data may be used freely, but attribution must be given to the original authors of the dataset. Another option is CC0, a licence made to reduce any legal and technical impediments to data sharing. CC0 provides creators a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law. Although CC0 doesnâ€™t legally require users of the data to cite the source, it does not affect the ethical norms for attribution in scientific and research communities. i.e., it does not exempt researchers from the obligation of citing the original data authors. 

> For **code / software** we recommend [MIT licence](https://opensource.org/license/mit) for its simplicity. However, other types of open source licenses and their descriptions can be found in [Open Source Initiative ] (https://opensource.org/licenses)

### Related resources 
> Include links (preferably a DOI) of any other datasets, publications and protocols that are related to this dataset.

# README template - Extended Metadata Elements
> In addition to the Essential elements, we recommend adding the following suggested sections for increased reproducibility and reusability of the dataset. 

## General information

### Purpose (Research Hypothesis)
> The overall rationale, reason, or intention for conducting a study that resulted in the data set.   
> Or the hypothesis that a study sets out to support (or disprove);

### Abstract
> A summary of the content of the dataset.  
> Should include a brief information about the biological material, technique used and measurement/experimental conditions. 
> The comprehensives details are to be recorded in sections below.
> Here we expect a short description that helps to understand the content of the dataset without its thorough examination.

### Funding Information 
This study was supported by [Funding Agency, Grant Number].

### Acknowledgments
> Add any acknowledgements

### Dataset Folder/File Overview
#### Data files list 

> All folders/files in the dataset should be listed here. If a file naming schema is used, it is fine to explain it instead of listing all the files. Filenames should include extension.

#### File formats 

> State the file formats used and how to open specific file formats when applicable.   
> Export any proprietary file formats to open formats whenever possible. For example, export images saved as .czi or .lif (Zeiss and Leica formats) to .tiff, or data saved as .mat or .spss to .csv or .json.  
> Make sure no data was lost or corrupted during conversion and test opening the converted files. Check that formulas and scripts  still function after export.   

#### Dataset structure

> Preferably include a directory structure similar to the one shown in the example below. When a large number of files is present, listing only main folders is fine, as long as the content of the folder is described.

 |--`Fly_monitoring_data/`       
 |  |--`Activity_recording.csv`              
 |  |--`Sleep_data.csv`    
         
 |--`Cultured_neuron_imaging/`  
 |  |--`wild_type_S01`  
 |  |--`wild_type_S02`    
 |  |--`wild_type_S03`    
 |  |--`clock_mutant_S01`    
 |  |--`clock_mutant_S02`    
 |  |--`clock_mutant_S03`
