# Who we are 
We are the [Biological Research Data Management (BioRDM) team](https://biology.ed.ac.uk/research/facilities/research-data-management), dedicated to supporting Open Science and [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Part of our work aims to support researchers into incorporating effective data management strategies into their daily research workflows, helping them to make the most of their data. 

# Understanding data through README files
If you want others to understand, interact with, reuse and build upon the data you share, you must provide a detailed description of the data. This data description is known as metadata. One of the simplest ways to record and share metadata is by writing a README file, which is simply a text file that contains key information about a dataset or a project. 

In this ongoing project, we are creating templates for README files designed for experiments conducted in different organisms, as well as patient data, with a focus on circadian related research (see our main page [Circadian data standards](https://github.com/circadianmentalhealth/circadian-data-standards)). These templates suggest essential sections to include in a README, ensuring it provides core information for others to understand and reuse the data.

To understand further and use our templates, see the step-by-step guide below. 

# Navigating README Folders: A Step-by-Step Guide

Welcome to your guide on how to effectively navigate README folders to enhance your project documentation experience. Follow these steps to ensure you make the most out of the resources provided.

## Step 1: Understand the Basics
- **Read General Information:** Start by familiarising yourself with the basic concepts of README files. This will help you understand their importance and the key components they should contain.

## Step 2: Check Your Essentials
- **Download the README Checklist:** Access and download the README checklist provided in the repository. This checklist will guide you through the essential elements your README should cover.
  -Access it [here](https://github.com/circadianmentalhealth/circadian-data-standards/blob/main/README-Templates/1-%20General%20Information%20%26%20Instruction/README%20Checklist.png)

## Step 3: Choose the Right Template
- **Use the Decision Tree:** Refer to the Decision Tree included in the repository to identify the README template that best fits the nature of your research or project.
  -Access it [here](https://circadianmentalhealth.github.io/circadian-data-standards/readme-templates.html)

## Step 4: Apply Your Knowledge
- **Follow the Folder Structure:** Navigate through the folder structure and use the suitable README template based on the results from the Decision Tree. This ensures that the README you compose is tailored to your specific needs.
