## Title: Effect of chronotype on localization
> A descriptive name given to the dataset.

### Abstract
> A summary of the content of the dataset.
> Should include a brief information about the biological material, technique used and measurement/experimental conditions.
> 
Activity of fruit flies of 5 genotypes: **WT, Tim/+, Tim>Kir, Kir/+, Tim0** was monitored using video tracking software.  
The selected genotypes were supposed to mimic various chronotypes: control, arrhythmic, early birds and night owls.  
Flies were entrained to **12h:12hr L:D** and then released into DD to measure circadian behaviour..

## Husbandry
> Care and cultivation of test organisms before the experiment.  
>
Flies were maintained on a media of sucrose, yeast, molasses, and agar under 12:12 LD cycles at 25 °C. 
One- to 3-day-old female flies were separated and maintained on standard cornmeal-yeast medium under LD12:12 cycles at 25 °C for 4 nights before experiments began.
