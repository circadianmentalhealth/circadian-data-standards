# Title: Type in the title/name
> A descriptive name given to the dataset.

## Date: YYYY-MM-DD
> A point in time associated with the lifecycle of the dataset.  
> Used mainly to cross-reference with other resources like Lab Notebooks or raw data.  
> Date must be expressed in ISO format: **YYYY-MM-DD** (e.g 2023-03-25)  

## Purpose (Research Hypothesis)
> The overall rationale, reason, or intention for conducting a study that resulted in the the data set.   
> Or the hypothesis that a study sets out to support (or disprove);

## Abstract
> A summary of the content of the dataset.  
> Should include a brief information about the biological material, technique used
> and measurement/experimental conditions. 
> The comprehensives details are to be recorded in sections bellow, here, 
> we expect a short description that helps to understand the content of the dataset without its thorough examination.

## Contributors
> List of persons making contribution to the creation of the dataset.  
> Use `FirstName LastName` format, each contributor name should be in a separate line which starts with `-`.  
> See the example entry bellow
- Ana Student
- Tom Thorough

--- students template starts ---
--- propose sections Marked with # and their expected content ---
--- rather than definitions list the aspects which should be captured in this section
--- For example, look at the Biosample section bellow, what other information should be provided
--- for fly experiments.
--- 
--- There are suggestions of other sections, complete the recommended content, 
--- and feel free to add your own sections

## Biosample
> Description of biological entity that was monitored / measured/ experimented on
> Typical content will have information about:
> Sample type: Whole mice / part / organ / cells / extracts....
> In vivo / Ex vivo / In vitro
