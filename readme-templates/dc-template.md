Flies were maintained on a media of sucrose, yeast, molasses, and agar under 12:12 LD cycles at 25 °C. One- to 3-day-old female flies were separated and maintained on standard cornmeal-yeast medium under LD12:12 cycles at 25 °C for 4 nights before experiments began.

## Experiment design

> A plan detailing how a study will be performed in order to represent the phenomenon under examination or to answer the research questions that have been asked.

> - environmental variables that typically influence clock like Light, Temperature, Feeding
> 
Flies were transferred into capillary tubes (containing sucrose-agar food) and loaded into Drosophila activity monitor (DAM) system.
They were kept in LD12:12 cycles at 25 °C. On the 3rd day test flies were subjected to sleep deprivation for 2.5 hours.  

## Protocols
- forced desynchrony protocol: this 2.5 hr stimulus was repeated every 7 hr
(allowing for a total of 4.5 hr of rest following each stimulus) 24 times until SD occurred at each hour around the clock.   
- abridged protocol: this 2.5 hr stimulus was applied 5 times: ZT0, ZT8 and ZT23 of day 3, ZT7 of day 4 and ZT6 of day 5.
- in DD protocol: sleep deprivation was applied at ZT 2.5 and ZT 10.5 under constant dark

## Control
> ->http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D035061  
> Groups that serve as a standard for comparison in studies. They are similar in relevant characteristics to the experimental groups 
> but do not receive the experimental intervention.
>
Undisturbed flies

## Interventions
> -> http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ERO_0000347  
> A process used to influence one or more factors in a research study.  
> Typical examples are light pulses, stress induction, drug treatments, activation of signalling pathways
>
- Sleep deprivation (SD): A 2 s vibration stimulus was applied approximately every 20 s with a randomized protocol for a time period of 2.5 hr using vortexer

- Sleep: Activity was measured in 1 min bins and sleep was identified as 5 min of inactivity (Hendricks et al., 2000).
- Sleep lost: is determined by the difference between baseline sleep and sleep during the sleep depravation
- Sleep gain: Calculated as the difference between sleep during rebound and sleep during the equivalent 4.5 hr at baseline.

## Measurement details? / Samples preparation
Fluorescence activated cell sorting and RNA-seq
Immediately following SD the flies were transfered into CO2 pads and brains were dissected in medium blocking neuronal activity. 40–45 brains per time point were pooled as a single sample and every condition and time point was run in triplicate for a total of twelve samples. Following papain digestion samples were transferred to the Northwestern FACS core on ice. GFP-positive cells were sorted on an Aria II FACS Cell Sorter. 300–550 cells per sample were obtained, lysed and used for library preparation. 

See RNA extraction protocol.

Reads were pseudo aligned and quantified using Kallisto (v0.46.1) (Bray et al., 2016) against a prebuilt index file constructed from Ensembl reference transcriptomes (v96). Kallisto was used to process paired end reads with 10 bootstraps. Differential expression analysis of the resulting abundance estimate data was then performed with Sleuth (v0.30.0; Pimentel et al., 2017).
