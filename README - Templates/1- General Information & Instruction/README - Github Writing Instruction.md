# Writing Language of README in Github

## Markdown Basics for Writing READMEs
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to create structured and visually appealing README files on GitHub. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

---

### 1. Headings
Use headings to organize your content into sections.
Markdown Syntax	Output Example
# Title	
(# Title: you will use one # to write the title in the shape, font and size that is seen before the cautation)
## Section	
(## # Title: you will use two # to write the section's title in the shape, font and size that is seen before the cautation)
### Subsection	
(### Subsection: you will use three # to write the subsection#s title in the shape, font and size that is seen before the cautation)

Example:
# My Dataset  
## Dataset Description  
### Variables and Units  

---
### 2. Text Formatting
Make your text stand out using bold, italics, or inline code.

*italic* or _italic_	(use * or _ before and after the word/sentence to write in italic)

**bold**	(use ** before and after the word/sentence to write in bold)

`inline code`	(use ` before and after the word/sentence to write in inline code)

---
### 3. Lists
Organize information with bullet points or numbered lists.

**Unordered list**

if the writing way is : 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8d366db-613b-4caa-a0fc-4e91611079e7)

the output will be: 

Unordered Lists
- Item 1  
- Item 2  
  - Subitem 2.1

**Ordered Lists**

if the writing way is:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1127a778-54aa-4d06-932a-9faa2d81a4a3)

the output will be: 

Ordered List
1. Step 1  
2. Step 2  
   1. Substep 2.1  

---
### 4. Links
Add clickable links to external resources or other sections.

if the writing way is: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d63372be-85af-40ac-ac4f-5bf95a4bd0ec)

the output will be:

[Text](https://example.com)	Text
[Section Link](#section-name)	Section Link

So what between the [] is teh text that you want people to click to go to the needed website or section, while what between () is the link/url or section name after a #, and there should not be any space in between.

---
### 5. Tables
Use tables to present data dictionaries or comparisons.

if the writing wya is:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fde9ff7e-e7a4-4809-9790-9d8b07ddcfeb)


the output will be:

| **Variable**    | **Description**                | **Type**   |  
|------------------|--------------------------------|------------|  
| `participant_id` | Unique ID for participants    | Categorical |  
| `age`            | Age in years                 | Numeric     |  

---
### 6. Code Blocks
Use code blocks for scripts, commands, or example code.

Inline Code: Use backticks; (`) at the begining of the code and another one at the end of it

fo example 
` Run the following command to install dependencies:  install.packages() `

---

### 7. Images
Include images for better visualization.

if the writing way is:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f01da78-0a94-4c5a-9b68-ff334b189bd5)
 
the image will be uploaded

![Sleep Data Visualization](https://example.com/sleep-data-graph.png)  

---

### 8. Blockquotes
Use blockquotes for notes, warnings, or highlights.

if the writing way is:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/818fb0ef-2dd6-45b8-8557-1c8cad567900)

the output will be:

> Note: Missing values were handled using mean substitution.  

---
### 9. Horizontal Lines
Separate sections with horizontal lines, by writing this dash - three time. the horizontal line will appear as the one after this section

---

### 10. Checklist
Create interactive checklists for tasks or required steps.

if the writing way of the checklist is like this: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f69aede-e85f-4c7e-86a2-5bd7eea0a016)

the output will be:

- [ ] Step 1: Load the data  
- [x] Step 2: Clean the data (Completed)  
- [ ] Step 3: Run the analysis

The example above could be encoded using the proposed format as:
```
## Title: Effect of chronotype on localization

### Authors 
- John Smith
- Su Key
- Fiona Arias

### Description 
Activity of fruit flies of 4 genotypes: **WT, CRY, GAL4, KIR** was monitored using video tracking software.  
The selected genotypes were supposed to mimic various chronotypes: control, arythmic, early birds and night olws.  
Flies were entrained and monitored under cyclic light conditions: 
normal **LD12:12**, short days **LD6:18** and long days **LD18:6**. 

### Start date: 2023-06-25
> Dates should be in the ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
```

Which is rendered as (for example if you see this file in github):
