# Title: Type in the title/name
> A descriptive name given to the dataset.

## Date: YYYY-MM-DD
> A point in time associated with the lifecycle of the dataset.  
> Used mainly to cross-reference with other resources like Lab Notebooks or raw data.  
> Date must be expressed in ISO format: **YYYY-MM-DD** (e.g 2023-03-25)  

## Purpose (Research Hypothesis)
> The overall rationale, reason, or intention for conducting a study that resulted in the the data set.   
> Or the hypothesis that a study sets out to support (or disprove);

## Abstract
> A summary of the content of the dataset.  
> Should include a brief information about the biological material, technique used
> and measurement/experimental conditions. 
> The comprehensives details are to be recorded in sections bellow, here, 
> we expect a short description that helps to understand the content of the dataset without its thorough examination.

## Contributors
> List of persons making contribution to the creation of the dataset.  
> Use `FirstName LastName` format, each contributor name should be in a separate line which starts with `-`.  
> See the example entry bellow
- Ana Student
- Tom Thorough
- Diana Helpful


## Biosample
> Description of biological entity that was monitored / measured/ experimented on.  
> Typical content will have information about:
> Species
> Strains used
> Age / developmental stage
> Sex
> If experiment was done in vivo / Ex vivo / In vitro
> Sample type: Whole fly / organ / tissues/ cells / extracts

## Husbandry 
> Describe how flies were cultured.  
> Include temperature, humidity, diet, housing.
> When applicable, include the time when food was offered

## Entrainment
> Describe light/dark cycles.
e.g., *Newly eclosed males were collected and entrained 4 to 7 days in a 12-h:12-h light:dark (LD) cycle*

## Experimental design
>Here you will describe your experimental design. Some suggestions based on typical circadian experiments are added below 

### Sleep measurement
> Describe the monitoring system and how fly activity was measured.
e.g., *"Individual flies were placed into approximately 65 mm tubes, which were then placed into Trikinetics Drosophila Activity Monitoring System (www.Trikinetics.com, Waltham, Massachusetts)"*
> Refer to images taken of the device used that are present in the dataset.
> Describe how sleep was defined (e.g, *"sleep was defined as periods of quiescence lasting 5 min or longer"*.    

### Stimuli
> Describe any type of stimuli such as vibration, light, olfactory, touch, hot or cold temperature, sound, electrical etc.  
> Describe any type of deprivation applied such as food, water, rest, sleep, mobility, etc.  
> Add the timing (ZT) and duration of stimuli, as well as to which individuals it was applied. 


### Mating
> Describe mating experiments such as mating success or mating competition.
> Add number of individuals of each sex involved, developmental stage and time (ZT).
> Add how mating success or competition was measured.
