> Date must be expressed in ISO format: **YYYY-MM-DD** (e.g. 2023-03-25)  

## Purpose (Research Hypothesis)
> The overall rationale, reason, or intention for conducting a study that resulted in the data set.   
> Or the hypothesis that a study sets out to support (or disprove);

## Abstract
> A summary of the content of the dataset.  
> Should include a brief information about the biological material, techniques used and measurement/experimental conditions. 
> The comprehensives details are to be recorded in sections below. 
> Here we expect a short description that helps to understand the content of the dataset without its thorough examination.

## Funding Information 
This study was supported by [Funding Agency, Grant Number].

## Acknowledgments
> Add any acknowledgements

## Ethical statements 
> Include ethical approval number and the guidelines used to conduct the experiment. 

## Dataset Folder/File Overview
Data file list: 

> All folders/files in the dataset should be listed here. If a file naming schema is used, it is fine to explain it instead of listing all the files. Filenames should include extension.  

Dataset structure:

> Preferably include a directory structure similar to the one shown in the example below. When a large number of files is present, listing only main folders is fine, as long as the content of the folder is described.

# Methodological information 

## Biosample description
> Description of biological entity that was monitored / measured/ experimented on.    
> Typical content will have information about:
 - Species;  
 - Genotypes/ lines used
     - include designations (e.g., *wt*, *mutant_name*) and unique identifiers when applicable
 - Provenance of animals and lines. If new lines were generated, describe how this was done (e.g., generation of new knockout lines)
 - Age / developmental stage range used- for standard zebrafish developmental stages look [here](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ZFS?p=classes);  
 - How eggs were obtained
 - Sex;
 - If experiments were done in vivo / Ex vivo / In vitro;  
 - Sample type collected: Whole fish / organ / tissues/ cells / extracts.
 - Number of animals studied

## Husbandry 
> Describe the conditions where the animals were grown. 
> Differentiate Control condition from Treatment conditions when applicable. 
> Differentiate embryo and adult fish conditions when applicable.     
> Typical descriptions will include:  
  - Feeding: type of diet / food availability / time when food was offered  
  - Housing:
    - Tank description including water volume. Include a link to commercial tanks where applicable. 
    - Number of individuals per container (e.g., embryo density per petri dish or number of adult fish per tank) 
    - Water quality/ treatment (e.g., dechlorinated, salt content, anti-fungal treatment, oxygenation) 
    - Water pH, temperature, conductivity
    - Frequency of water change
  - Entrainment: add light/dark cycles where fish were entrained and the light intensity and light type when applicable. 

## Experimental design and conditions
> Here you will describe your experimental design. For example, if fish were divided in different groups and the treatments applied to which group. Describe the control group.   
> For any type of measurement, describe the animals that were selected for analysis and the number of samples.  
> If necessary, include separate README files for each experiment type (measured data type). For example, a separate README file for Imaging experiments and a separate README file for gene expression experiments.  
> Describe measured techniques and the measured data. Some suggestions are described next. Feel free to include new sections or delete sections that are not applicable to your work: 

### Treatments
> Describe any specific treatment applied. For example:   
  - light or dark pulse stimuli;  
  - phase-shifting;    
  - changes in feeding time or food type;   
  - pharmacological treatments (drug name, concentration, brand and identifier number) 

> Add timing of interventions - **use Zeitgeber time (ZT)**

### Live activity monitoring
> Describe the activity monitoring system. Typical descriptions include:
  - Developmental stage and sex of monitored animals, as well as growth conditions if different that what has been described before. 
  - Monitoring system used (e.g., infrared motion sensors, videotracking (ViewPoint ZebraBoxes), etc.)
  - How data was measured and recorded.
  - Software name and version used in for activity data analysis
  
### Spawning 
> Describe how spawning was analysed. 
  - describe any specific apparatus used for that (e.g., specific tanks used as spawning boxes).  
  - number of males and females involved and their developmental stage
  - water quality and temperature
  - photoperiod (e.g., 14:10 light-dark cycles) and light intensity
  - describe how spawning was recorded and how the eggs were counted (include any software used and its version) 
   
### Sample preparation
> When the experiment involves euthanasia and sample preparation, include: 
   - Animals selected for euthanasia (sex, developmental stage)
   - Time when animals were euthanized
   - Euthanasia method (e.g., ice water or chemical)
   - Sample collected from fish - 
   - Sample preparation protocol
   - Number of biological samples analysed

### Imaging
> If not described earlier in sample preparation, include a description of sample preparation and mounting for imaging or add links to corresponding protocols.
   - Imaging method: (e.g. fluorescence microscopy, bioluminescence, etc)
   - Image acquisition:   
     - Instrument used
     - Image acquisition parameters (filters used, magnification, etc.)

     - Describe if you are sharing raw, processed, and/or segmented images.
     - File formats
     - Image dimensions
     - Channel information
     - Image processing methodology

## Data analysis
> Describe how the data was analysed including any software used and its version.  
> Include any data processing (detrending, smoothing, averaging, etc).  
> Describe the methods used for period and phase analysis.   
     
# Dataset usage and access

## Licence
This dataset is shared under [Insert licence here]
