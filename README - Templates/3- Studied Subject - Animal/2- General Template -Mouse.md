# Title: Type in the title/name
> A descriptive name given to the dataset.

## Date: YYYY-MM-DD
> A point in time associated with the lifecycle of the dataset.  
> Used mainly to cross-reference with other resources like Lab Notebooks or raw data.  
> Date must be expressed in ISO format: **YYYY-MM-DD** (e.g 2023-03-25)  

## Purpose (Research Hypothesis)
> The overall rationale, reason, or intention for conducting a study that resulted in the the data set.   
> Or the hypothesis that a study sets out to support (or disprove);

## Abstract
> A summary of the content of the dataset.  
> Should include a brief information about the biological material, technique used
> and measurement/experimental conditions. 
> The comprehensives details are to be recorded in sections bellow, here, 
> we expect a short description that helps to understand the content of the dataset without its thorough examination.

## Contributors
> List of persons making contribution to the creation of the dataset.  
> Use `FirstName LastName` format, each contributor name should be in a separate line which starts with `-`.  
> See the example entry bellow
- Ana Student
- Tom Thorough
- Diana Helpful

--- students template starts ---
--- propose sections Marked with # and their expected content ---
--- rather than definitions list the aspects which should be captured in this section
--- For example, look at the Biosample section bellow, what other information should be provided
--- for fly experiments.

--- There are suggestions of other sections, complete the recommended content, 
--- and feel free to add your own sections
## Ethical statements 
> Include ethical approval number and the guidelines used to conduct the experiment. 

## Animals
> Description of biological entity that was monitored / measured/ experimented on.    
> Typical content will have information about:
 - Species;  
 - Genotypes/ strains used
     - include designations (e.g., *wt*, *mutant_name*) and unique identifiers when applicable
 - Provenance of animals
 - Age / developmental stage - see ontologies for developmental stages [here](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MMUSDV/?p=classes) ;  
 - Sex;
 - Animal weight at start of experiment. Include unit used. 
 - Experiments were done in vivo / Ex vivo / In vitro;  
 - Sample type collected: Whole mouse / organ / tissues/ cells / extracts.
 - Number of animals studied

## Husbandry 
> Describe the conditions where the animals were grown. Differentiate Control condition from Treatment conditions when applicable.   
> Typical descriptions will include:  
  - Feeding: type of diet / food availability / time when food was offered  
  - Housing: apparatus dimensions, material and link to commercial apparatus where applicable. 
    - Number of individuals per box
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Bedding type
    - Light intensity
    - Type of light (fluorescent, LED panel, colour temperature, etc)
    - Presence of wheels
    - Sound control (are cages soundproof?)
  - Entrainment: include light/dark cycles where animals are entrained and light intensity used.
